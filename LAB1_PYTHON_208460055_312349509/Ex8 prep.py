        You should generate the txt files by yourself (using python, not manually): One
        txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other txt file has a list
        of happy numbers up to 1000 .
        [Prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. Yes,
        Happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on
        Wikipedia]
